Video alignment configuration is stored in a structure with the following
fields; missing fields will be filled with default values:

"avgeventinterval" is the desired approximate interval between brightness
  change events within a grid tile. This is used to tune detection. Default
  is 1 second.

"blacklist" is a cell array with labels of streams to ignore when processing.
  Default is { 'Monitor', 'Composited' }.

"maxframes" is the maximum number of frames per stream to process. Default
  is Inf. This can be set lower to run fast tests of the alignment code.

"quiet" is true to suppress console output. Default is false.

"tilegrid" [ width height ] is the number of grid tiles to divide each image
  frame into. Default is [ 1 1 ] (no subdivision).


This is the end of the file.
