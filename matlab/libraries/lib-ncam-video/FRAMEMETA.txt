Frame metadata for a repository is stored in the following format:


- The top-level variable is a structure indexed by video stream label
  containing per-stream configuration variables.

- Per-stream configuration variables are structures with the following fields:

  "indices" is a vector storing frame numbers for recorded frames.
  "times" is a vector storing frame timestamps (in seconds).
  "fnames" is a cell array containing frame image filenames, including paths.


This is the end of the file.
