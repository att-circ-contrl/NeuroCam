Raw video intensity series are stored in the following format:


- The top-level variable is a structure with one field per video stream,
  indexed by video stream label, containing per-stream series variables.

- Per-stream series variables are structures with one field per component,
  containing per-component series variables. Typical components are
  'red', 'grn', and 'blu' for RGB images and 'mag' for greyscale, but the
  storage format does not constrain the component names that might exist.

- Per-component series variables are 3-dimensional arrays indexed by
  [h,v,fnum]. The "h" and "v" indices indicate the tile that is being
  processed. Frame numbers are indices used to look up frames in the frame
  metadata structure (per FRAMEMETA.txt).
