This is an interim partial version of the alignment script that makes
histograms of difference data but doesn't do anything else with it.

As far as I can tell by eye, the best way to proceed is to look for the most
variable sqrt(n) tiles in any given stream and average those, rather than
looking at the full-frame average.

It may also be a good idea to get a correlation matrix between tiles and
group tile sets that are most correlated, within a stream. This would catch
the case where two areas of the image are highly variable but are behaving
very differently.

Alternatively we could just select the top sqrt(n) tiles individually without
averaging them, and use each of them as alignment candidates against other
streams' tiles.
