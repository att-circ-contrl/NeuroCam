NOTE - Some cameras are well-behaved; these can be used with the unmodified
driver. Driver modification is needed for cameras that try to eat all of the
USB bandwidth.

Rebuilding works fine using the "active" symlink, but "clean" doesn't.
Enter the directory manually (without the symlink) and invoke the clean script.

For Mint 17, we're using "3.16.38-modded".
This was ostensibly the "trusty" version (3.13), but an upgrade occurred
that broke driver compatibility.

FIXME - We're on Mint 18 now. Need to get and modify the UVC driver for this
kernel version.
