To get relevant configuration information for new camera models, plug them
into the NeuroCam, shell in (using the instructions in the NeuroCam manual),
run the following commands, and save the outputs:

v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --info
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-framesizes=MJPG
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-ctrls
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-ctrls-menus

These are the commands that the NeuroCam scripts run internally to get
information about how to use the cameras.

NOTE - "/dev/video0" is the first detected video camera. To guarantee this
device number, unplug other cameras and wait a few seconds before plugging
in the new camera.
