Invocation:
luvcview -d /dev/video0 -f MJPG -s 1280x720 -i 30

Clicking "auto-exposure off" fails, but "auto-exposure on" turns it off.
This is a known UI bug.

mplayer will reset auto-exposure on _exit_, or when _resizing_.
So, using luvcview to tweak it only works for the first call, and needs
the same size setting.

Even at low exposure, 1920 tops out at 20 fps.

Not sure if lighting will fix, or if it's bandwidth-related.
Update: lighting does not have any effect on auto-exposure's selection?
