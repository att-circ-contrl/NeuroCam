* From 10 Oct. 2020:

Per a web forum post, the c930 only accepts the following exposure values:

3, 4, 9, 19, 38, 77, 156, 312, 624, 1250, 2074

Anything else holds for one frame and then resets.


* From 12 Feb 2021:

- Changing exposure in-flight works, to any value. The camera maps them to
the fixed values (reporting the set value but acting like the fixed one).

- Setting "gain", "contrast", and "brightness" also works (independently).

- Changes have to be made while the camera is running, apparently.
