Notes for the Asus RT-N66U router:

- router config page is at 192.168.1.1
- setting admin account to login "admin" pw "administrator"
- setting SSIDs to "NeuroCam-2.4GHz" and "NeuroCam-5GHz", pw "neurocam"
(names must differ for MAC filtering to work properly across both)
- disabled WPS
- forced "accept" type MAC filtering on wifi
- dhcp pool is from .64 to .254
- lease is left at 86400
- manually assigned cubi to 192.168.1.2
- the router is supposed to handle LAN dns by default if in dhcp mode; 
host entries can be manually added by writing to the jffs flash device
- disable UPnP in WAN settings (it exposes internals to the world)
- WAN is dhcp by default; change this if necessary
