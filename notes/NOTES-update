Quick-start notes for updating a NeuroCam:

- Be on the same network as the NeuroCam (like you would for using it).
- Shell into it with:  "ssh neurocam-admin@192.168.1.nnn"
- Give the "neurocam-admin" account password.
- Become root with:  "su"
- Give the root account password.
- Insert the USB stick, and mount it with:  "mount -t auto /dev/sdb1 /usb"
(All of the NeuroCams in our lab will have that device and mountpoint.)
- Run the NeuroCam update script with:
  "/usb/neurocam-install/scripts/do-update.sh"
- Reboot the NeuroCam with:  "shutdown -r now"
  (Alternatively shut it down with:  "shutdown -P now")


...If the NeuroCam is internet-connected (and firewalled), you can
optionally update the OS with:
  "/usb/neurocam-install/scripts/do-mintupdate.sh"
This will take a long time, and you'll have to press "enter" a few times
when it asks questions.
