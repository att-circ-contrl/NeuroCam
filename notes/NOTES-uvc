To download and rebuild the UVC driver:

*** Problem: The Trusty source is 3.13, the headers are 3.16, and there
was a change to V4L2's video buffer structure between those versions.

*** Attempt from 16 Nov 2016:

- Download kernel 3.16.38 in .tar.xz form from www.kernel.org.
- Copy the uvc source from drivers/media/usb/uvc.
- (Building the kernel is optional; can be done per below if needed.)

This builds and functions correctly (without needing a kernel build) in
unmodified form.



*** Another attempt:

This requires a rebuild of the appropriate kernel source. For my version of
Mint:

(make and enter a scratch directory)
git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-trusty.git
(wait while this downloads 2.5 gigabytes)
cp -r ubuntu-trusty/drivers/media/usb/uvc (location for copy of uvc source)
make oldconfig
(hit enter for the default answer to every question)
make prepare
make modules
(wait while this rebuilds modules and creates Module.symvers)
(this takes a very long time; at least an hour)

...Then "make -C" using the build tree's root.

FIXME - This has missing version information, and "modprobe --force" still
fails, due to bad exec format.

*** End of latest attempt.


*** FIXME - Old stuff begins.
(NOTE - This is for an old kernel version!)
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git uvcvideo
cd uvcvideo
git remote add uvcviceo git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/uvcvideo.git
git remote update
git checkout -b uvcvideo-master uvcvideo/uvcvideo-next

(NOTE: This clones the entire Linux kernel source tree - about 1 GB)

(NOTE - The kernel doesn't need to be compiled; this is just a way to get
the source for the uvc driver.)
*** FIXME - Old stuff ends.
