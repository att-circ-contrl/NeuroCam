VLC can be invoked with:

vlc --v4l2-width=1280 --v4l2-height=720 v4l2:///dev/video0

This defaults to uncompressed data, not mjpeg.

Options documented at:  https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/v4l2/

Of interest:
--v4l2-fps 15.0

Getting info:
vlc -vvv --color v4l2:///dev/video0 --run-time 1 vlc://quit -I dummy -V dummy -A dummy
...this gives lots and lots of useless cruft and needs to be manually killed.

It does, however, say:
capability flags 0x05000001 (overall 0x85000001)
supports YUYV (YUV 4:2:2)
supports compressed MJPEG
emulates a number of other raw formats.
Lists frame rates at this format (up to 25 Hz at 1280x720).

... "v4l" supports mjpeg ("--v4l-mjpeg"), but v4l2 doesn't?
... ah. Use "--v4l2-chroma mjpeg". -> "invalid codec mjpeg".
... ah. use "mjpg", not "mjpeg".
...getting invalid frame errors?  --> these are from libav and are known.

... "--no-audio" is useful for me.

* "cvlc" is the command-line invocation ("vlc" brings up an interface with a
warning).


Alternate formatting (: args are per-stream, not global):

cvlc v4l2:///dev/video0 :v4l2-width=1280 :v4l2-height=720 :v4l2-chroma=MJPG 
  :v4l2-fps=30
(fps snafu)
(faster but still questionable if 30 fps for 640x480)


To screencast from the command line using vlc:

cvlc screen:// --screen-fps=30.0
":sout=#transcode{vcodec=MJPG,vb=1000,scale=0.5,acodec=none}:http{mux=
mpjpeg,dst=:8080/stream.mjpg}" :sout-keep

(The " marks are needed to prevent the shell from messing with {}.)


To play an MJPEG in the GUI:
vlc http://localhost:8080/stream.mjpg
