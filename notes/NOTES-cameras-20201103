- Original NeuroCam cameras (used with kiosks) were Logitech c920 cameras.
- Replacement NeuroCam kiosk cameras were Logitech c930 cameras (much better
  low-light performance).


- Enclosure cameras were similar to the following:

(Lots of vendors sell similar cameras; ours were from Amazon.)

The lens mount on the enclosure cameras is "M12 3.6mm" (thread and focal
length, respectively). We can swap in wide-angle/fisheye lenses if we can't
find cameras with them already attached.

The two original enclosure cameras had 90 and 110 degree FOVs if I remember
correctly.

Tape over the light sensor and IR LEDs. Taping over the light sensor makes it
stay in IR mode, and taping over the LEDs prevents the IR LEDs from confusing
the eye-tracker.
