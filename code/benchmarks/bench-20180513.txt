Processing a 7.9 gigabyte folder:

- 18 minutes aligning timestamps.
- 103 minutes compositing.
- 20 minutes resizing monitor stream.
- 13 minutes transcoding to make movies.

Net result: 19 minutes per gigabyte / 3 gigabytes per hour.

...I should really write a custom libjpeg program to do the compositing and
resizing.

(I'm pretty sure compositing _is_ multithreaded, but doublecheck that too.)
