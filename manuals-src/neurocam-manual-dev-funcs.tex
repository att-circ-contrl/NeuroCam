\chapter{Library Functions}
\label{funcs}

\fixme{Content goes here.}

This should give an overview of how libraries are split up, and an overview 
of the functions offered by each library.

While the function and variable lists can be more or less the extracted 
declarations and comments, there should be a preamble for each library 
explaining how all of the pieces fit together and are intended to be used.
